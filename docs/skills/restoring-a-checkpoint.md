## Procedure

1. `go-getter checkpoint list`: newest first, with the label and ref.
2. `go-getter checkpoint restore <label>` shows what would change (M modified, D deleted, A created since) and changes nothing.
3. If the list is right, add `--yes`: it puts back the M and D files in the working tree only. Files created since stay; remove them yourself if unwanted.
4. A host's own rewind or restore command may undo editor changes, but not what a shell command did: use the checkpoint for that.
