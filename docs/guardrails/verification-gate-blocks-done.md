derivation-note: Given the quality bar of routing is the verification checks (0016, 0031), completion must wait for them, since an instruction alone lets a failing step end.

  enforcement:
    - tier: 1
      check: Run `go-getter verify --class implement` before reporting a step done
    - tier: 2

## Guardrail

Before reporting an implement or debug step done, run `go-getter verify --class <class>` and fix every failure. Where the host supports it, a stop hook enforces this and hands over to a human after the escalation limit.
