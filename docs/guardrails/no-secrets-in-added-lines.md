## Guardrail

Added lines carry no private keys, provider tokens, JWTs or `password = <value>` assignments. A false positive is marked with `go-getter:allow-secret` on its line, or its path is added to the skipped paths (compiler/test/**). A leaked secret must be rotated; deleting the commit is not enough.
