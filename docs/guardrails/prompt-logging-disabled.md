derivation-note: Given host telemetry can export prompt content, a restricted path read once would leave the machine through logs, so the setting must be off wherever the host exposes it.

    - tier: 3
      check: Host settings files that exist have prompt logging switched off

## Guardrail

Keep prompt and content logging disabled in host settings; `go-getter apply` sets it and the check fails when a settings file turns it back on.
