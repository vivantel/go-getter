derivation-note: Given the agent must not read personal data it does not need (0106), tool output that carries it must be masked before the agent sees it, where the host allows.

      check: Do not paste personal data into prompts or files; a prompt and a file write are never masked

## Guardrail

Tool output that carries email addresses, card numbers or IBANs (and []) reaches the agent with each value replaced by a per-session name. Hosts that cannot replace tool output show it unmasked (the coverage report lists them); prompts and file writes are never masked, so personal data is not pasted into either.
