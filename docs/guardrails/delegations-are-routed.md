derivation-note: Given routing picks the cheapest eligible tier by expected total step cost (0016), a delegation that bypasses the router can pick an ineligible or needlessly costly model, so the host must route it where it can.
go-getter:
  enforcement:
    - tier: 1
      check: Where no hook routes the delegation, run `go-getter route --class <class> --host <host id>` and delegate with the `delegateModel` it returns
    - tier: 2
      check: Pre-delegation hook sets the delegated model from the router, or denies when no model is eligible

## Guardrail

A delegation to a role uses the model `go-getter route` returns for its class, passed as its `delegateModel` (the value the host's delegation tool accepts): the host hook sets it where the host allows, otherwise ask the router before delegating. After the maximum number of escalations a step goes to a human.
