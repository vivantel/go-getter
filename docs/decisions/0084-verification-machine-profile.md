## Decision

Format, lint and typecheck run locally; tests run locally and in CI; static analysis, build, integration and e2e run only in CI. `go-getter verify` and the stop gate run only `local` and `both` checks; `ci` and `both` checks belong to CI (pack verification-gate@0.2.0).

## Why

Thin machines should not run builds, full suites or analyzers locally, yet the quality bar must still hold (decision 0071).
