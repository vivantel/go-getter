## Decision

A step that fails verification moves one tier up at most 2 times; after that it goes to a human and is never retried (pack cost-routing@0.1.0). The verification gate stops use the same bound.

## Why

An unbounded retry loop can burn unlimited tokens (guardrail routing-escalation-bounded).
