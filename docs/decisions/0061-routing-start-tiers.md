## Decision

Starting tiers and efforts per task class are recorded in this decision's data; verification escalates a failed step one tier up (pack cost-routing@0.1.0).

## Why

Routing minimises expected total step cost among eligible models (decisions 0016, 0020, 0032); classes carry the quality bar.
