## Decision

The pre-tool hook saves the working tree to a hidden git ref before a gated command (triggers: gated-action; keep: 10), and the agent does it where no hook runs (pack checkpointing@0.1.0).

## Why

A hard reset or a recursive delete cannot be undone from the host (decision 0097); a checkpoint costs a few kilobytes.
