## Decision

Delegate searches, log reads and test runs to a subagent only when expected total step cost, including handoff and cache loss, is lower than running inline; see the cost-routing pack. (pack context@0.1.0.)

## Why

Every always-loaded token is paid on every request and every subagent; cached prefixes stay cheap only if stable (facts 0003, 0011).
