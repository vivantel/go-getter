## Decision

A review step ends with a reviewer-agent verdict on the change against the brief, the decisions and the guardrails; no review step passes without one. (pack verification-gate@0.1.0).

## Why

A reviewer sees what the author's own checks cannot: intent, scope and guardrail conformance (decisions 0014, 0031).
