## Decision

Do not change model, effort or the instruction file mid-task. Where a host offers a pre-model-switch hook, switches ask for confirmation. (pack context@0.1.0.)

## Why

Every always-loaded token is paid on every request and every subagent; cached prefixes stay cheap only if stable (facts 0003, 0011).
