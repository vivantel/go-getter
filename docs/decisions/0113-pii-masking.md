## Decision

Where the host can replace tool output, the post-tool hook replaces email addresses, payment card numbers and IBANs, and the types in [], with names such as `[email-1]`: the same value keeps its name within a session (pack governance@0.4.0). Secrets keep the single marker `[redacted by go-getter]`.

## Why

An agent that does not need personal data should not read it, and a stable name lets it tell two values apart (decision 0106).
